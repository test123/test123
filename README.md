### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the profile of Avi Dutta, a Software Development Manager currently navigating the challenges of innovation at Amazon.com's Madrid hub. ðŸ˜Š

In case you're on the hunt for a specific repository, most of mine are kept private. However, don't hesitate to reach outâ€”I'm more than happy to provide access if you are interested. 

In my day-to-day, you'll find me tinkering with a variety of projects. I'm a firm believer in perpetual learning, and strive to stay connected with the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering. 

Are you as passionate about technology as I am, and are interested in exploring potential opportunities at Amazon? Connect with me on LinkedIn <img src="https://www.keesingtechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Linkedin-Icon.png" alt="drawing" height="1%" width="1%" />  and let's chat! https://www.linkedin.com/in/avidutta/

Bye for now!
