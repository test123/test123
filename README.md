### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

In case you're looking for a specific repository, most of my repositories are private, so please feel free to ping me, and I'll be more than happy to give you access.

I'm always working something or the other, whether it's something super-serious, or some weird stuff that I'm just having fun with.

Are you as passionate about tech as I am, and would like to see if you would be a good fit at Amazon?
